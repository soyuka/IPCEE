# IPC EE [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/soyuka/IPCEE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/soyuka/IPCEE)

IPC combined with [EventEmitter2](https://github.com/asyncly/EventEmitter2)

## What for?

First, [RTFM child.send(message[, sendHandle])](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_send_message_sendhandle).

> The sendHandle option to child.send() is for sending a TCP server or socket object to another process. The child will receive the object as its second argument to the message event.

This means that you won't be able to do things like:

```javascript
child.send('message', {some: 'data'}, [data])
```

[List of accepted instances](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/9010dd26529cea60b7ee55ddae12688f81a09fcb/lib/child_process.js#L436). If you look a but further in the code, internal messages are sent with the [first argument]([](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/9010dd26529cea60b7ee55ddae12688f81a09fcb/lib/child_process.js#L430)
). As stated in the docs:

> There is a special case when sending a {cmd: 'NODE_foo'} message.

Then, I thought it could be nice to do:

#### Child
```javascript
ipc.send('started')
```

#### Master
```javascript
const child = fork('child')
child.once('started', dosomething)
```

Internally I just had to combine EventEmitter and use the first argument to pass an array of arguments.

## Usage

### Child

```javascript
  const ipc = IPCEE(process)

  ipc.send('started')

  ipc.on('ping', function() {
    ipc.send('pong') 
  })
```

### Master

```javascript
  const server = fork('some/node/app.js')
  const client = IPCEE(server)

  client.once('started', () => {
    client.send('ping')
  })

  client.once('*.pong', () => {
    console.log('\o/')
  })
```

Or with namespaces:

### Child

```javascript
  const ipc = IPCEE(process, {wildcard: true})

  ipc.send('started')

  ipc.on('ping:me', () => {
    ipc.send('me:pong')
  })
```

### Master

```javascript
  const server = fork('some/node/app.js')
  const client = IPCEE(server, {wildcard: true})

  client.once('started', () => {
    client.send('ping.*')
  })

  client.once('*.pong', () => {
    console.log('\o/') 
  })
```

## Caveat

Using the first argument of [child_process.send()](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_send_message_sendhandle), Nodejs IPC will transport strings. Javascript objects are encoded with json internally. That said, You won't be able to pass instances.

Example:
```javascript
process.on('uncaughtException', err => {
  ipc.send('error', err.toString(), err.stack)

  process.nextTick(() => {
    process.exit(1) 
  })
})
```

Here, Temptation would be to send the full Error object but `JSON.stringify(new Error('test')`) will return `'{}'`.

## Native IPC features

IPCEE does **not** override any of the internals methods. This means that you'll still be able to get messages from the standard way:

```js
process.on('message', (m, handle) => {
  if(m === 'server') {
    //do something with handle 
  }
})
```

But it will handle accepted instances in an easy way too. For example, sending a Socket:

```js
//server.js
ipc.send('socket', sock)
//child.js
ipc.on('socket', function(sock) {
  assert(sock instanceof Socket)
})
```
